            Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's
            convinced he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the
            world. Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with
            independent spirit Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision,
            and a future, he never imagined.

                    He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a
                    boy named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten,
                    Woody served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he
                    upheld by looking out for each member of the group. When
                    Andy enters adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is
                    donated to a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains
                    with Bonnie for some time, before choosing to become an
                    owner-less antique devoted to helping lost toys find owners,
                    alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.
